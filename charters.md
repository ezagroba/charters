### Photo exercise

Get into pairs (or groups of three)  

🗣️ Sharer: Spend a minute describing a recent photo on your phone 

✍️ Listener(s): Write down specific questions; ask the most important one.

📲 Sharer: Show the listener(s) the photo.

🔄 Switch who's the sharer and who's the listener.

### What is exploring?

- Wandering + Purpose = Exploring
- Wandering - Purpose = Lost
- If you don’t use what you find, don’t explore.


===

### What is a charter?

- Help you design your testing
- Uncover new questions --> plan for more tests
- Generally three parts

===

### Charter template

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you’re exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

### Charter examples 

- Search through the log file in a text editor to see if there are any errors or warnings. 

- Upload different file types in the UI to see if the size and file type constraints in the error message are accurate.

- <span class="green">Search through</span> <span class="blue">the log file</span> <span class="green">in a text editor</span> <span class="red">to see if there are any errors or warnings</span>.  

- <span class="green">Upload different file types</span> <span class="blue">in the UI</span> <span class="red">to see if the size and file type constraints <span class="blue">in the error message</span> are accurate.</span>


===

### Charter examples 

- Send non-required fields in the JSON body using the Python requests library to see if the API accepts them.

### Wandering: Here We Go
[https://wego.here.com/](https://wego.here.com/)  

Take enough notes to remember what you saw so that we can write charters (and then explore) later.

===

### Write some charters

Spend a few minutes writing charters  by yourself.  

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you’re exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

## Compare charters

Differences between yours and your pair/group

===

## Charter writing
### debrief

===

## Explore <span class="blue">target</span> with <span class="green">resources</span> to discover <span class="red">information</span>.

- Explore the log file with a text editor to discover if there are any errors or warnings. 

- Explore uploading different file types with the UI to discover if the error message is accurate.


===

## Exchange charters
### Choose one for everyone at your table to execute

===

### Exploring 

Work with your pair/group.
If you find something outside your current scope, write a new charter for later.

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you’re exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

### Reflect with your table

- Did you stick to the mission?
- Did you complete the charter?
- What else do you want to test now?
- What could you test given more tools, time, data, expertise, etc.?
