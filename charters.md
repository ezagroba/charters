### What is exploring?

- It's never possible to specify all the requirements.
- Wandering + Purpose = Exploring
- Wandering - Purpose = Lost
- If you don‚Äôt use what you find, don‚Äôt explore.


===

### What is a charter?

- Help you design your testing
- Uncover new questions => plan for more tests
- Generally three parts

===

### Charter template

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

### Charter examples 

- Search through the log file in a text editor to see if there are any errors or warnings. 

- Upload different file types in the UI to see if the size and file type constraints in the error message are accurate.


===

### Charter examples

<span class="blue">target</span> | <span class="green">resources</span> | <span class="red">information</span>

- <span class="green">Search through</span> <span class="blue">the log file</span> <span class="green">in a text editor</span> <span class="red">to see if there are any errors or warnings</span>.  

- <span class="green">Upload different file types</span> <span class="blue">in the UI</span> <span class="red">to see if the size and file type constraints <span class="blue">in the error message</span> are accurate.</span>


===

### Charter examples 

- Send non-required fields in the JSON body using the Python requests library to see if the API accepts them.

### 2. Wandering: Here We Go
[https://wego.here.com/](https://wego.here.com/)  

Take enough notes to remember what you saw so that we can write charters next.

===

### 3. Write some charters

Spend two minutes writing charters‚Ä® by yourself.  

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

## 3. Charter writing
### debrief

===

### 4. Exploring 

If you find something outside the current scope, write a new charter for later.

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

## 4. Exploring
### debrief 

===

### Pull up the user story and charters from the recent PUT API call my team made

===

### 5. User story for Here We Go: Construction

As a driver or cyclist, I want to see the location and details of planned road construction and closures on the traffic view so I can plan my route.

===

### 5. User story: Acceptance Criteria

- Display the road construction and closure icons for zoom level 14 and lower.
- Use numbers to aggregate roadworks concentrated in a particular area.
- Selecting a particular construction icon provides details about the start and end times.
- For road closures, use  a red circle with a horizontal white bar.
- For road construction, use a red diamond with a white person digging.

===


## Explore <span class="blue">target</span> with <span class="green">resources</span> to discover <span class="red">information</span>.

- Explore the log file with a text editor to discover if there are any errors or warnings. 

- Explore uploading different file types with the UI to discover if the error message is accurate.
