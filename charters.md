### Why are we here?
- Trying out a workshop for a testing conference
- At the end: what you find valuable vs. don&#x27;t


===

### Photo exercise

Get into pairs (or groups of three)  

- Sharer: Spend a minute describing a recent photo on your phone 

- Listener(s): Write down specific questions, ask the most important one

- Sharer: Show the listener(s) the photo

Switch who's the sharer and who's the listener.

### What is exploring?

- Wandering + Purpose = Exploring
- Wandering - Purpose = Lost
- If you don’t use what you find, don’t explore.


===

### What is a charter?

- Help you design your testing
- Uncover new questions --> plan for more tests
- Generally three parts

===

### Charter template

- *target*: where you’re exploring
- *resources*: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- *information*: what you hope to find

===

### Charter examples

- Search through the log file in a text editor to see if there are any errors or warnings.
- Upload different file types in the UI to see if the size and file type constraints in the error message are accurate.
- Send non-required fields in the JSON body using the Python requests library to see if the API accepts them.

### Wandering: Here We Go
[https://wego.here.com/](https://wego.here.com/)  

Take enough notes to remember what you saw so that we can write charters (and then explore) later.

===

### Write some charters

Spend a few minutes writing charters  by yourself.  

- *target*: where you’re exploring
- *resources*: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- *information*: what you hope to find

===

## Compare charters

Differences between yours and your pair/group

## Charter writing
### debrief

## Exchange charters
### Choose one to execute

===

### Testing: round 2 

If you find something outside your current scope, write a new charter for later.

- *target*: where you’re exploring
- *resources*: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- *information*: what you hope to find

===

### Reflection

- Did you stick to the mission?
- Did you complete the charter?
- What else do you want to test now?
- What could you test given more tools, time, data, expertise, etc.?

## Testing: round 2
### debrief

===

### Mindmap

Let's discover what ideas we focused on.

## Retrospective
