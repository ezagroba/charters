### What is exploring?

- It's never possible to specify all the requirements.
- Wandering + Purpose = Exploring
- Wandering - Purpose = Lost
- If you don‚Äôt use what you find, don‚Äôt explore.


===

### What is a charter?

- Help you design your testing
- Uncover new questions => plan for more tests
- Generally three parts

===

### Charter template

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

===

### Charter examples 

- Search through the log file in a text editor to see if there are any errors or warnings. 

- Upload different file types in the UI to see if the size and file type constraints in the error message are accurate.


===

### Charter examples

<span class="blue">target</span> | <span class="green">resources</span> | <span class="red">information</span>

- <span class="green">Search through</span> <span class="blue">the log file</span> <span class="green">in a text editor</span> <span class="red">to see if there are any errors or warnings</span>.  

- <span class="green">Upload different file types</span> <span class="blue">in the UI</span> <span class="red">to see if the size and file type constraints <span class="blue">in the error message</span> are accurate.</span>

[https://wego.here.com/](https://wego.here.com/)  

Take enough notes to remember what you saw so that we can write charters next.

===

### Write some charters

Spend two minutes writing charters‚Ä® by yourself.  

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer

### Exploring 

If we find something outside the current scope, we'll write a new charter for later.

- <span class="blue">*target*</span>: where you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="green">*resources*</span>: what you‚Äôre using/how you‚Äôre exploring
- <span class="red">*information*</span>: what question you want to answer
