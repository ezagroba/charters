### Why are we here?
- Trying out a workshop for a testing conference
- At the end: what you find valuable vs. don&#x27;t

===

#### Here We Go
Install the HereWeGo app on your phone, or go to:
[https://wego.here.com/](https://wego.here.com/)

===

### What is exploring?

- Exploring = wandering + purpose
- Lost = wandering - purpose
- If you don’t use what you find, don’t explore.

===

### Photo exercise

Get into pairs (or groups of three)  
2 minutes each

- Sharer: Describe a recent photo on your phone 

- Listener(s): Write down questions, ask the most important one

## Photo exercise 
### debrief

### What is a charter?

- Help you design your testing
- Uncover new questions --> plan for more tests
- Generally three parts

===

### Charter template

- *target*: where you’re exploring
- *resources*: what you’re using/how you’re exploring
- *information*: what you hope to find

===

### Charter examples

- Search through the log file in a text editor to see if there are any errors or warnings.
- Upload different file types in the UI to see if the size and file type constraints in the error message are accurate.
- Send non-required fields in the JSON body using the Python requests library to see if the API accepts them.

### Testing: Round 1
